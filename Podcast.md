This research article explores the impact of vacuum impregnation and different air-drying temperatures on the anthocyanin composition and antioxidant capacity of cranberry juice incorporated into an apple matrix. The authors studied the incorporation of cranberry juice into fresh apple slices using vacuum impregnation, followed by stabilization of the product through air-drying and freeze-drying. The results demonstrated that vacuum impregnation was effective in incorporating cranberry juice without negatively affecting its bioactive compounds. While air-drying led to a significant loss of the initial anthocyanin content, freeze-drying preserved all individual anthocyanins. The study concluded that freeze-drying and air-drying at 40°C produced the best final product in terms of bioactive compound retention and antioxidant capacity. DOI: 10.1016/j.lwt.2015.06.044

This scientific article explores the effects of calcium and trehalose on the volumetric deformation of apple slices during air drying. The authors used nonlinear irreversible thermodynamics to analyze mass transport and deformation-relaxation of apple tissues during the drying process. The results show that calcium does not have a significant effect on volumetric deformation, while trehalose helps to maintain the integrity of the cellular structure, reducing irreversible deformations and improving the quality of the final product.

This study investigates the effects of dietary supplementation with maqui (Aristotelia chilensis) in obese mice induced by a high-fat diet. The results indicate that maqui supplementation improves insulin sensitivity, reduces weight gain, and enhances thermogenic activity. Specifically, maqui supplementation was found to induce a brown-like phenotype in subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT), marked by increased expression of genes involved in thermogenesis, de novo lipogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, these beneficial effects may be linked to improved FGF21 signaling and upregulation of key metabolic regulators, including Chrebpb, CREG1, PGC1a, and SREBP1c.

This research article examines how the use of pulsed electric fields (PEF) as a pretreatment affects the mechanical and sorption properties of dried apples. The authors found that PEF increases the water retention capacity of the apples and alters the shape of the sorption isotherm, suggesting an increase in crystalline components within the apple matrix. The study also investigated the plasticizing and antiplasticizing effects of water, finding that PEF can induce an antiplasticizing effect at low water levels. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how PEF can be used to modify the physical properties of dried apples, potentially enhancing their quality and shelf life.

This scientific article explores the development of rice bran oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with soy flour proteins and polysaccharides, designed as a base for food products that can be incorporated into ketogenic diets. The study examines the impact of formulation (ketogenic ratios and oil mass fractions) and high-pressure homogenization conditions (number of homogenization cycles) on the properties of the resulting emulsions. The authors found that emulsions prepared after five homogenization cycles exhibited greater resistance to coalescence compared to those prepared in a single cycle. Additionally, they analyzed the rheological behavior and overall stability of the emulsions, finding that most of the emulsions remained stable during seven days of refrigerated storage.

This article presents a study on improving the nutritional and sensory quality of semi-dried strawberries using vacuum impregnation with bilberry juice. The researchers evaluated different sugar concentrations in the bilberry juice and found that impregnation with a 30% sugar solution produced the best results in terms of total polyphenol content, antioxidant activity, and sensory acceptance. Although the impregnation and drying processes reduced the strawberries' firmness and crunchiness, the results demonstrated that vacuum impregnation is a promising technique for producing semi-dried strawberries enriched with beneficial bioactive compounds.

This scientific article explores the use of pulsed electric fields (PEF) to extract biomolecules from the microalga *Chlorella*. The authors examined how PEF treatment conditions, solvent type (water or DMSO), and extraction time influence the recovery of proteins, polyphenols, chlorophyll, and carotenoids. They also assessed the mineral content and relative nutritional value (NRV) of the extracts. Using fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the authors analyzed the impact of PEF treatment on *Chlorella*’s cellular morphology. The results showed that PEF enhances biomolecule extraction, likely due to electroporation, which increases cell permeability. The study concludes that PEF-treated *Chlorella* extracts could be a promising source of antioxidants and minerals for various populations. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.134615

This scientific article explores the use of pulsed electric fields (PEF) as a pre-extraction technology to obtain bioactive compounds from two microalgae, _Chlorella vulgaris_ and _Arthrospira platensis_ (Spirulina). The authors compare the efficiency of PEF with conventional aqueous extraction for recovering proteins, carbohydrates, pigments (chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids), phenolic compounds, and phycocyanin. The results demonstrate that PEF enhances the extraction of these compounds, especially from Spirulina, attributed to electroporation and increased cell membrane permeability in the microalgae. Additionally, PEF extracts exhibit higher antioxidant activity and promote the growth of _Lactobacillus rhamnosus_, a probiotic, suggesting that these extracts could serve as functional ingredients in food applications. The study concludes that PEF is a viable and promising extraction technology, offering advantages in efficiency, speed, and sustainability over traditional extraction methods.
