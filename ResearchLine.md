<div style="text-align: justify;">
The Innovative Processing Technologies research line explores advanced techniques to enhance the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of food processing. Initially, the focus was on leveraging Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF) for extracting bioactive compounds and enhancing the mechanical properties of food matrices. These early studies demonstrated the potential of PEF in breaking down cellular structures, allowing for efficient nutrient extraction, and opening pathways for valorizing by-products, particularly in fruits, vegetables, and seafood by-products.

As the research progressed, new technologies such as Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Cold Plasma were integrated, further advancing the scope of applications. These technologies enabled the extraction of high-value bioactives under mild conditions, preserving their functional properties while also offering solutions for decontaminating food surfaces and improving food safety. For instance, Cold Plasma treatments have shown promise in reducing microbial load and pesticide residues, enhancing the shelf-life of fresh produce.

Subsequent work introduced Ultrasound and Infrared Technology for specialized metabolite extraction and polyphenol recovery. These methods improved extraction efficiency and reduced processing time, making them attractive as sustainable alternatives to conventional techniques. Research in this phase focused on the practical applications of these techniques for different food products, revealing improvements in bioactive stability, antioxidant activity, and overall product quality.

Currently, the goal is to optimize these innovative technologies for large-scale implementation. Studies are examining how these methods can be combined (e.g., PEF with ultrasound or supercritical CO₂) to maximize the retention of nutritional and functional properties in processed foods. The research continues to refine parameters to meet industry needs while minimizing energy consumption and environmental impact, aiming to create efficient, scalable, and sustainable processing solutions for the food industry.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The Food Product Development research line focuses on creating innovative, health-promoting, and sustainable food products tailored to meet evolving consumer needs. Initially, the research centered on emulsions and functional foods development trhough vacuum impregnation, investigating formulations using plant-based oils and food by-products. These early studies explored the stabilization of emulsions rich in bioactive compounds, laying the groundwork for applications in ketogenic diets and plant-based product development.

As this line of research advanced, the focus broadened to include the development of nutritious and sustainable snacks made from fruit and vegetable by-products. This work aimed to address food waste by upcycling agricultural waste into high-value snack products, providing both environmental and health benefits. For example, studies demonstrated that incorporating antioxidants and fiber-rich extracts from fruit peels and other residuals into snacks could improve nutritional content while reducing the environmental impact of food production.

The latest phase of research has explored how functional ingredients, such as probiotics, natural antioxidants, and color-stabilizing agents, can be integrated into these products to enhance their health benefits and appeal. Studies on the stability of bioactive compounds, such as anthocyanins in blueberry juice or vitamin D in protein-fortified foods, highlight methods to retain functional qualities over time. Additionally, advanced drying and impregnation techniques have been used to create shelf-stable snacks that maintain the sensory qualities and nutritional profiles consumers seek.

Looking ahead, this research line aims to optimize formulations for scalability, focusing on the nutritional and functional potential of ingredients while ensuring product stability. Future directions will likely involve enhanced ingredient combinations and processing methods, expanding the possibilities for sustainable, health-oriented foods that align with market demands.

## 3. Functional and Nutritional Properties:
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The Functional and Nutritional Properties research line investigates bioactive compounds and their potential health benefits, focusing on antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Early studies in this line aimed to identify and characterize bioactive compounds in various natural sources, such as rice, mushrooms, and fish by-products. These foundational studies laid the groundwork by exploring the stability, potency, and efficacy of these compounds, especially in combating oxidative stress and inflammation.

Over time, the research expanded to evaluate bioactive stability within food matrices and how these compounds interact with different ingredients. A key focus was on understanding the effects of bioactives, like phenolic acids, on human health, particularly regarding antioxidant and anti-melanogenic activity. Experiments also evaluated how these compounds behaved in complex matrices such as dairy and plant-based foods, allowing for a deeper understanding of their role in functional food formulations.

More recent work in this line has concentrated on modulating gut microbiota and metabolic health through functional ingredients. Studies have demonstrated that carotenoids, probiotics, and other nutritionally dense components can support gut health, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance overall metabolic function. Additionally, research into bioactive preservation has explored methods like coating applications to stabilize these compounds during storage, extending their functional benefits over time.

Currently, this research line seeks to refine the delivery and bioavailability of functional compounds. Advanced techniques, such as encapsulation and novel coating applications, are being explored to optimize the release and effectiveness of these compounds within the human body. Looking forward, future directions aim to integrate these findings into everyday foods, enhancing both their nutritional profiles and potential health benefits in ways that are accessible and appealing to consumers.

## 4. Applications in Food Safety and Sustainability:
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The Applications in Food Safety and Sustainability research line focuses on developing strategies to enhance food safety and promote sustainable practices in food production. Initially, this line of research concentrated on identifying contaminants—such as pesticide residues and heavy metals—in various food matrices and assessing the risks they pose to consumer health. These early studies highlighted the importance of monitoring and mitigating contaminants in the food supply chain, establishing a foundation for safer food practices.

As the research progressed, attention shifted to emerging technologies for contaminant degradation and reduction. Techniques such as plasma treatment, green extraction methods, and the application of natural decontaminants demonstrated promising results for reducing harmful residues on fresh produce and processed foods. For instance, studies showed that cold plasma treatments could effectively decrease pesticide levels and microbial contamination, offering a sustainable, chemical-free alternative for enhancing food safety.

In parallel, this line of research has explored the valorization of food by-products, aiming to reduce waste by transforming agricultural residues into valuable bioactive compounds and functional ingredients. This approach not only addresses sustainability by reducing waste but also creates new economic opportunities within the food industry. Research has focused on optimizing extraction methods for recovering nutrients from by-products, such as fish and plant-based residues, which can be repurposed in food or nutraceutical applications.

Currently, the focus is on integrating these safety and sustainability practices at a larger scale. This includes refining techniques to be energy-efficient and scalable, ensuring they are viable for industry-wide adoption. Future directions in this research line will likely explore more comprehensive systems for food safety and waste reduction, fostering a sustainable, circular economy within the food sector.
